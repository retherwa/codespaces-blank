## ABOUT ME
### I have been a healthcare professional for close to two decades now. I am also a US Marine, I spent four years in the United States Marine Corps(USMC) prior to getting into healthcare. I joined the USMC right out of highschool in 2004. During highschool, I worked on a farm doing manual labor. That is a brief summary of my career portfolio.
### My name is Wade Retherford and I am exploring the Tech and development field. I have always taken pride in the work I do and look forward to going on this new journey.
